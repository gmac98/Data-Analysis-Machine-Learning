Optimizing Air France's Digital Advertising Strategy

Introduction:

In this project, I will delve into the intricate web of Air France's digital advertising data, analyzing key performance metrics across various aspects.  
I will conduct a thorough examination of the dataset, scrutinizing the distribution of numerical and categorical characteristics to unearth patterns 
that might influence the effectiveness of the airline's digital strategy.

Analysis Overview:

My investigation will focus on the interplay between ad placement, click-through rates, and average cost-per-click. This will enable me to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of campaigns across different search engine platforms (SEPs). Leveraging advanced data visualization tools, I will craft a data-driven 
narrative that reveals insights on keyword performance, the efficacy of bid strategies, and their combined impact on bookings and revenue generation. 
Through this detailed analysis, I aim to pinpoint both the strengths and weaknesses of Air France's current online advertising approach. Ultimately, 
the goal is to provide actionable recommendations that will enhance the airline's online presence and drive customer acquisition.

Preliminary Findings:

While Air France's paid search campaigns appear to be yielding positive returns, there's room for optimization to improve return on ad spend (ROAS) 
and targeting across various channels. The analysis suggests that refining keyword selection and focusing on Air France's brand and website terms could 
lead to higher booking intent from users. Additionally, a closer look is needed to optimize Google Ads performance specifically for the US market, 
while Yahoo's high US ROAS warrants further evaluation to determine its cost-effectiveness compared to Google. The MSN-Global campaign presents an 
opportunity for increased budget allocation due to its high ROAS (second only to Kayak), and Overture's low cost-per-click merits investigation into its 
booking conversion rates and overall effectiveness. Notably, Kayak stands out with a significantly higher average booking value and ROAS, suggesting it 
reaches an audience with a strong intent to book.

By building upon these initial findings, I will develop a comprehensive strategy to optimize Air France's digital advertising efforts and 
maximize its return on investment.

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS

1. Diversify beyond Google-US: While Google-US drives the most traffic, consider expanding reach to
other channels (Barker, 2020) like Yahoo-US and MSN-Global for cost-effective conversions. These 
channels boast higher ROA and lower CPC compared to Google-US.

2. Optimize campaigns based on channel strengths (D, 2021):
Yahoo-US: Focus on optimizing campaigns further due to its high ROI and booking probability (Smulders, 2022)
despite lower average revenue per booking.
Overture(Global and US): Investigate their effectiveness as they have low booking probabilities
compared to other channels.
MSN (Global and US): Allocate budget strategically due to their good performance in revenue
per booking and ROI.
Google-US: Optimize targeting and potentially explore Position 1-2 and Position 5-10 bid
strategies for higher effectiveness.

3. Consider Kayak as a publisher channel(Edelman & Heller, 2015): Analyze its effectiveness further 
due to its exceptionally high average revenue per user, potentially targeting a niche audience with 
higher spending power.Consider utilizing it for brand awareness and direct bookings.
