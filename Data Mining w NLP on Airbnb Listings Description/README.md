Analyzing Airbnb Listing Descriptions for Business Insights

Project Goal:
This project combines Text Analytics with NLP and Data Visualization to uncover valuable business insights within Airbnb listing descriptions.  I'll be working with the Airbnb dataset loaded into a MongoDB cluster.

Data Acquisition:
I'll be using the Airbnb dataset loaded into a MongoDB cluster. 

Analysis Tools:

Text Analysis: R programming will be used to explore and structure the textual content of the descriptions, perform text mining techniques, and generate visualizations for each framework.
It follows the following structure -
1. Extracting the Airbnb dataset from MongoDB
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Tokenization and remove stopwords as well as custom stopwords according to the features of the description
4. TF-IDF for term frequency
5. Bigrams & Trigrams network to illustrate the relationships between words
6. Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover topics inherent in the description corpus

Data Visualization: I'll leverage Tableau dashboards to create insightful visualizations that tell a data story about the Airbnb listings.

Project Report: This report details my findings, including interesting visualizations and the insights they reveal, text analysis techniques used and the discovered patterns, and business recommendations based on my analysis.
