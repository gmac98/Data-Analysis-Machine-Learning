World Bank Data Analysis: Life Expectancy vs Fertility Rate (1960 & 2020)

Introduction

In this project, I will be analyzing World Bank data on life expectancy and fertility rates across different countries. As a data analyst, my objective is to create visualizations that 
compare these factors for two distinct periods: 1960 and 2020.

Data and Methodology

The provided data includes a CSV file containing information for both years and separate R vectors. I will utilize R programming to explore and manipulate the data. My primary task is to 
generate scatterplots for each year, with life expectancy on the Y-axis and fertility rate on the X-axis. To enhance the visualization, I will categorize the data points by region to 
identify potential trends within geographical areas.

Expected Outcome

The final deliverable will be a single R script incorporating the following elements:
- R code used for data manipulation, visualization creation, and regional categorization.
- Two scatterplots – one for 1960 and another for 2020 – depicting the relationship between life expectancy and fertility rate across different countries.
- Data analyst insights based on the visualizations. This will involve comparing the scatterplots and identifying any significant changes in the relationship between the two factors over the 60-year period.

 Data insights based on visualizations
 
 Global life expectancy has significantly increased between 1960 and 2020. In 1960, the average
 life expectancy across regions was around 50-60 years, while in 2020, it has jumped to about 70-80 years.

 Fertility rates have generally declined across all regions between 1960 and 2020. The scatter plots
 highlight a downward trend in fertility rates across all five regions. In 1960, the average fertility
 rate hovered around 6 children per woman, whereas in 2020, it has almost halved to roughly 3 children
 per woman.This represents a nearly 50% decline over 60 years.
 While all regions experienced declines in fertility rates, the extent of the decrease varied.
 For example, the median fertility rate in Africa fell from around 7 children per woman to 4.5
 children per woman, while the median rate in Europe dropped from around 2.5 children per woman
 to 1.5 children per woman. Despite the decline, Africa's median fertility rate in 2020 is still
 above the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman needed for a population to maintain its size
 without migration.In contrast, Europe's median fertility rate in 2020 is now below the replacement rate.

 The negative correlation between life expectancy and fertility rate appears to have persisted
 between 1960 and 2020. Although the data points for both years exhibit some spread, the overall trend
 suggests that regions with higher fertility rates tend to have lower life expectancy, and vice versa.
 While some regions like Europe and the Americas have witnessed a convergence of their fertility
 rates and life expectancy towards the upper end of the spectrum, others like Africa and the
 Middle East continue to diverge, with fertility rates remaining higher and life expectancy lagging behind.

 Regional variations in life expectancy and fertility rate patterns persist. The graph indicates
 that even though global trends exist, significant disparities remain between different regions.
 For instance, in 2020, Africa still bears the burden of the lowest life expectancy and highest
 fertility rate compared to other regions. While Europe has the highest life expectancy and the
 lowest fertility rate. This suggests that there are other factors besides fertility rate that are
 affecting life expectancy in these regions.

 The interquartile range (IQR), which represents the spread of the middle 50% of the data,
 has also shrunk in most regions. This indicates that the distribution of life expectancy and fertility
 rates has become less variable over time, with fewer countries now having extremely high or
 low life expectancy and fertility rates compared to 1960.
 The relationship between life expectancy and fertility rate is not linear. This means that
 the difference in life expectancy between countries with high and low fertility rates is not constant.
 For example, the difference in life expectancy between countries with fertility rates of 2 and 4 children
 per woman appears to be smaller than the difference in life expectancy between countries with fertility
 rates of 6 and 8 children per woman.
